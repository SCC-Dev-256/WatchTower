# This file contains the HandleErrors decorator, which is used to handle errors and log them using the ErrorLogger.
# The decorator integrates with the ErrorLogger and provides a unified error handling mechanism.
# The decorator has the following parameters:
# - operation: The operation or service that the error occurred in.
# - error_type: The type of error.
# - severity: The severity of the error.
# - include_analysis: Whether to include analysis of the error.
# - max_attempts: The maximum number of attempts to retry the operation.
# - delay_seconds: The delay in seconds between attempts.

# The decorator uses the ErrorLogger to log the error and the ErrorAnalyzer to analyze the error.
# The decorator also includes a retry mechanism to handle errors that occur during the operation.

# The following areas are blank and require input from the user:
# - Additional error handling logic for specific error types or logging requirements that are not yet defined.
# - Configuration details for retry logic, such as exponential backoff or jitter, that may need customization.
# - Any additional metrics or logging categories that the user might want to track.
# - Specific logic for handling different error types in the `HandleErrors` decorator.
# - Detailed implementation for methods like `log_error` and `analyze_error` within the ErrorLogger and ErrorAnalyzer classes.
# - Integration with other monitoring or alerting systems that the user might want to include.

# Levels of abstraction that need to be made specific:
# 1. Error Handling Logic: Define specific logic for handling different types of errors (e.g., network, streaming, recording).
# 2. Retry Logic: Customize and add any additional retry mechanisms, such as exponential backoff or jitter.
# 3. Metrics: Customize and add any additional metrics that need to be tracked.
# 4. Logging: Configure log formatting and output destinations as per the application's requirements.
# 5. Error Analysis: Implement detailed logic for analyzing errors and providing insights.
# 6. Error Entry Creation: Ensure the error data captures all necessary details for each error type.
# 7. Error Processing: Define the specific steps to process and handle each error type in the `HandleErrors` decorator.
