# This file contains the PerformanceMonitor class, which is used to monitor and log performance metrics for encoders.
# The PerformanceMonitor class has the following methods:
# - record_client_metrics: Records performance metrics for a given encoder.
# - _check_thresholds: Checks if any metrics exceed thresholds.

# The following areas are blank and require input from the user:
# - Additional error handling logic for specific error types or logging requirements that are not yet defined.
# - Configuration details for retry logic, such as exponential backoff or jitter, that may need customization.
# - Any additional metrics or logging categories that the user might want to track.
# - Specific logic for handling different error types in the `record_client_metrics` method.
# - Detailed implementation for methods like `_check_thresholds`.


# Levels of abstraction that need to be made specific:
# 1. Error Handling Logic: Define specific logic for handling different types of errors (e.g., network, streaming, recording).
# 2. Retry Logic: Customize and add any additional retry mechanisms, such as exponential backoff or jitter.
# 3. Metrics: Customize and add any additional metrics that need to be tracked.
# 4. Logging: Configure log formatting and output destinations as per the application's requirements.
# 5. Error Analysis: Implement detailed logic for analyzing errors and providing insights.
# 6. Error Entry Creation: Ensure the error data captures all necessary details for each error type.
# 7. Error Processing: Define the specific steps to process and handle each error type in the `record_client_metrics` method.
